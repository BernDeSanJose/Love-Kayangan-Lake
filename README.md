### Kayangan Lake is a crystal-clear freshwater lake in Coron, featuring underwater rock formations, caves and islets. Itâ€™s a popular spot for photographers, for fairly obvious reasons, and is said to be the cleanest lake in all of the Philippines. The water is so clear that you can often see down to a depth of 10 metres, enabling even non-swimmers to see the untouched rock formations from viewpoints around the lake.
